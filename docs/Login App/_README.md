> In this folder, we have the key documents that detail both our existing and proposed authentication processes for the new Analyze App. These documents are intended to provide a clear roadmap for our evolution and to facilitate open discussion among our team.
> 
1. **Current Auth Flow**: This document provides a thorough overview of the current authentication process within the Analyze Dash App. It delves into the specifics of our current approach, including the user roles and database structure, providing a foundational understanding of the logic we have in place.

2. **New Auth Flow**: In this document, we propose a comprehensive, updated authentication process that takes into account our future needs and growth. It outlines new user roles, suggests a robust and scalable database structure, and details a new invitation flow. Furthermore, it presents recommendations for implementing Microsoft's Single Sign-On (SSO) mechanism, and other considerations for securing endpoints between the backend and frontend of the application.

**These documents are living resources that could evolve as our requirements and understanding expand so your contributions, suggestions, and insights are most welcome.**
